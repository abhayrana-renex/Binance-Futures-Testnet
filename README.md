- Testnet: enforced in code via python-binance Futures URLs.
- Logging: both stdout and `bot.log` in the working directory.

## Troubleshooting
If the bot exits during health check or prints a Binance error, refer to the message shown and the tips below. You can also inspect logs:
```bash
tail -n 100 /Users/abhayrana/prime/bot.log
```

Common issues:
- -2015 Invalid API-key, IP, or permissions
  - Use Futures Testnet keys from the Futures Testnet website
  - Ensure the key has Futures permissions
  - Confirm you‚Äôre on `https://testnet.binancefuture.com`

- -1021 Timestamp for this request is outside of the recvWindow
  - Your system clock is off. Enable automatic time sync (macOS: System Settings ‚Üí Date & Time)

- -2019 Insufficient margin
  - Reduce order size, add Testnet balance, or use lower leverage

- -1111/-1116/-1118 Precision or filter errors
  - Adjust quantity/price to match step size and tick size
  - Try small quantities like `0.001`

- Import warnings in your editor for `binance.*` or `rich.*`
  - Install the packages in the active interpreter: `pip install python-binance rich`

## Project Structure
- `bot.py`: Main CLI, `BasicBot` class, logging, validations, order methods, health check, account summary UI

## Notes
- This bot is for the Binance Futures Testnet only; it is not wired to mainnet.
- Use small quantities on testnet to avoid margin errors.
